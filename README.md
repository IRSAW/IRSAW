Intel RealSense Spatial Awareness Wearable 


This project is about augmenting the sense of the visually impaired using a wearable which gives vibrotactile feedback 
on the body to make them aware about their surroundings.  
A depth camera is used to see what is in front of a person and the vibration motors on the body notify the person 
about where the object is in the front based on what the camera sees.
